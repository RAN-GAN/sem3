A string vmName (the name of the virtual machine).
A string osType (the OS type, e.g., "Ubuntu_64", "Windows10_64").
An integer ramSizeMB (RAM size in MB).
An integer diskSizeGB (Virtual disk size in GB).
Output Format

Print "VM created successfully" if the VM is created.
Print "Error:" if creation fails.
Constraints

1024 ≤ ramSizeMB ≤ 32768
10 ≤ diskSizeGB ≤ 1000
